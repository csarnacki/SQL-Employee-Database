# SQL-Employee-Database

This is an employee tracker project using MySQL to create and display a database that holds sample employee information such as 
their name, their role and their salary. 

This project primarily uses Node.js and MySQL to function. It also uses the inquirer package (specifically, inquirer 8.2.4),
the console.table package for displaying MySQL tables in the commmand line, the dotenv package to store secure data, and 
the mysql2 package to import MySQL.

When Node.js is run in the command line, a list of options appears in the CLI and the user can then use the arrow keys to choose 
what they would like to see. Sample data is already included in the SQL files, or the user can decide to create their own data
to use.

Here is a link to a video demonstrating the program in use.
